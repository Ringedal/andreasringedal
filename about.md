quote: Specializing in UX, realizing meaningful concepts
---
I offer expertise within the full UX spectrum, from initial exploration to implementation. I have experience of digital and physical product design and I'm particularly interested in when the two merge.  

I specialize in the early stages of the design process including research, synthesis, ideation, prototyping and testing. I'm comfortable exploring new methods and always put the user first without forgetting the business side of it.

I've worked with great people from Volvo Cars, MÃ¶lnlycke Health Care, AstraZeneca, Bosch, Electrolux, UserTribe, Abilia, Herber among others.

I'm currently broadening my skill set by digging deep into the world of front-end development. In a few months, I'll relocate to Canada for a year on my Working Holiday Visa.

I'm always looking to collaborate with awesome people. If you have your own business or are responsible for your company's design process and would be interested in working together, let me know.

I'm currently based in Sweden but available anywhere or remote.
