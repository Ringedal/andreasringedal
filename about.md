I offer expertise within the full UX spectrum, from initial exploration to implementation. I have experience of digital and physical product design, and I'm particularly interested in when the two merge.  

I specialise in the early stages of the design process including research, synthesis, ideation, prototyping and testing. I'm comfortable exploring new methods and always put the user first without forgetting the business side of it.

#### Tools and frameworks I like using:
* Sketch
* Principle

* InVision

I've worked with great people from Volvo Cars, MÃ¶lnlycke Healthcare, AstraZeneca, Bosch, Electrolux, UserTribe, Abilia, Herber among others.

I'm currently broadening my skill set by digging deep into the world of front-end development. Soon, I'll relocate to Canada for a year on my IEC Working Holiday Visa.

I'm always looking to collaborate with awesome people. If you have your own business or are responsible for your company's design process and would be interested in working together, let me know.

I'm based in Sweden but am available for work anywhere or remote.
