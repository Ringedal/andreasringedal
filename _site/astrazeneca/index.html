<p>What do you get when you mix Medtech, IoT and asthma?</p>

<p>Turbu+</p>

<p>By attaching a small device to your asthma inhaler you can easily track your daily inhalations and get reminders on your phone if you missed one.</p>

<h4 id="goals">Goals:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Design new solutions for existing product</li>
  <li>Deliver wireframes and user stories</li>
  <li>Act as support for decisions regarding UX and design</li>
  <li>Consider Medtech regulations</li>
</ul>

<p>I worked together with colleagues from inUse with implementing new functionality for the Turbu+ solution. It is a complex service with many stakeholders and regulations such as patient data privacy. Turbu+ is supported for various markets hence the solution had to support multi-languages.</p>

<h4 id="platforms">Platforms:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>iOS</li>
  <li>Android</li>
  <li>Web</li>
</ul>

<p>The app itself is meant for end users but in addition, there is a web portal for doctors who can track their patient’s data.</p>

<p>For this release, the main focus was on self-enrollment and symptom tracking.</p>

<p>Self-enrollment was heavier from the technical viewpoint. From a user perspective, it was a fairly simple sign-up process. What we did include in the onboarding process though, were instructions on how to assemble the device and pair it with the phone via Bluetooth.</p>

<p>Symptom tracking is done by the user and the idea of symptom tracking itself is complex hence everyone is different and experience his or her symptoms in different ways. We spoke to specialists in the field to boil it down to something tangible and useful for the users. Some weeks before the project deadline, the managers decided to bring in a ready solution for symptom tracking due to the fact that it was clinically tested and approved. A major factor for companies in the medical field.</p>

<p>The upside was that our solutions were more or less the same, at least an ego boost. The flipside was that our UI patterns were completely different. Reminding time of the project we focused on finding ways for how to implement the ready solutions and make sure it would have a look and feel which reminded of the rest.</p>

<h4 id="tools">Tools:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>Sketch</li>
  <li>Principle</li>
  <li>inVision</li>
  <li>Zeplin</li>
</ul>

<p>Process
We worked in-house with the creative process. Sketching, thinking and interviewing. At the end of every deadline, we presented ideas and made proposals. Always one sprint ahead.</p>

<p>For every successful sign-off, we then produced wireframes, visual assets and guidelines for developers to implement. I also took on the challenge of animating the app using Principle.</p>

<p>As soon as the updated version of the app is released I will add more visuals.</p>

<h4 id="in-retrospect">In retrospect:</h4>
<ul>
  <li>There are many regulations within the healthcare</li>
  <li>The art of getting your design approved when dealing with a lot of stakeholders</li>
  <li>Arguing for the impact of design in a fairly conservative market</li>
  <li>How to merge two completely different apps into one’s such an interesting field with endless possibilities</li>
</ul>
