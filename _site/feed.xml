&lt;p&gt;What do you get when you mix Medtech, IoT and asthma?&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Turbu+!&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;By attaching a small device to your asthma inhaler, you can easily track your daily inhalations and get reminders on your phone if you missed one.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design new solutions for existing product&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliver wireframes and user stories&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Act as support for decisions regarding UX and design&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Consider Medtech regulations&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I worked together with colleagues from inUse with implementing new functionality for the Turbu+ app, which supports various markets. The app itself is for end users, and there is a web portal for doctors who can track their patient’s data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For this release, the primary focus was on self-enrollment and symptom tracking.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;platforms&quot;&gt;Platforms:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;iOS&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Android&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The self-enrollment sequence was more complex from a technical viewpoint. From a user perspective, it was a reasonably simple sign-up process. What we did include in the on-boarding process though, were instructions on how to assemble the device and pair it with the phone via Bluetooth.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The user does symptom tracking, and the idea of symptom tracking itself was more complicated since everyone is different and experience his or her symptoms in different ways. We spoke to specialists in the field to boil it down to something tangible and useful for the users. Some weeks before the project deadline, the managers decided to bring in a ready solution for symptom tracking as it was clinically tested and approved, a significant factor for companies in the medical field.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The upside was that our solutions were more or less the same, at least an ego boost. The flip-side was that our UI patterns were completely different. Reminding time of the project we focused on finding ways for how to implement the complete solution and make sure it would have the same look and feel like the overall GUI.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tools-used&quot;&gt;Tools used:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Sketch&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Principle&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;InVision&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Zeplin&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;We worked in-house with the creative process. Sketching, thinking and interviewing. At the end of every deadline, we presented ideas and made proposals. Always one sprint ahead.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For every successful sign-off, we then produced wireframes, visual assets and guidelines for developers. I also took on the challenge of animating the app using Principle, used for external usability testing.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As soon as the updated version of the app is released, I will add more visuals.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-retrospect&quot;&gt;In retrospect:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;There are many regulations within the healthcare&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;The art of getting your design approved when dealing with many stakeholders&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Arguing for the impact of design in a somewhat conservative market&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How to merge two completely different apps into one’s such an exciting field with endless possibilities.&lt;/li&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Electrolux is transitioning into the digital era by making connectivity and Internet of Things a priority. They had developed a low-fidelity prototype for controlling a washing machine via a smartphone app. I was hired together with a colleague from inUse to perform usability tests, highlight problems and make suggestions for improvements.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/electrolux-aeg-app-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Three phones with prototype interface used for usability testing&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Write scripts and questionnaires&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Set test environment&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Perform tests&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Identify problem areas&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliver test summary&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;As always when it comes to usability testing (which is also the fun part), be prepared for the unexpected and be curious how other resonate. For these tests, a methodology developed by designers from Electrolux were used, measuring effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction for every task.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/acreo-ux-lab-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Acreo UX lab&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Tests were held in Acreo’s UX Lab in Stockholm. When arranging the setting, our top priority was to record the phone’s screen to see how participants interacted as well as catching hand gestures. Secondly, we had one camera focusing on the participants face to capture facial expressions. For audio recording, we had a hidden microphone inside a folded towel.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;test-procedure&quot;&gt;Test procedure:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Background questionnaire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Initial exploration to capture first interaction and impressions, expectations and mental model for the UI&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Task scenarios,  collecting data of performance, effectiveness and efficiency.&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Satisfaction questionnaire&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Semi-structured post-use interview&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/acreo-ux-lab-1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Acreo UX lab&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Although participants weren’t aware of the number of people watching they did sense the presence of others. It was a challenge to make participants feel comfortable doing the test, especially for the part when they pretended to operate a washing machine by clicking on a paper prototype.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/acreo-ux-lab-3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Acreo UX lab&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Usually, you quickly get a feeling for in what part of the test most test persons are going to struggle. It’s easy to judge too soon and draw conclusions, but as long as you continue to ask open questions and make sure they resonate about their actions, the unexpected insights will come.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-retrospect&quot;&gt;In retrospect:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Usability testing is how you catch the unexpected ideas early&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;A well-structured test and report have a more significant impact within the organisation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Is the web really for everyone? No, it’s not. There is a group of people who are foreseen by not being able to browse websites nor use apps like most of do on a daily basis. Abilia develop products to make sure these people become more independent and can take control of their everyday life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I was Design Lead for the work in developing the new version of MEMOPlanner, helping people with cognitive impairments become more independent in their life.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;goals&quot;&gt;Goals:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Redesign MEMOPlanner&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Design new UI patterns&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Keep key features&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Deliver graphics&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Craft wireframes&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Put together a design guideline for the developers&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;A cognitive disorder can affect a person in different ways such as experiencing difficulties with learning, memory, perception and problem-solving. Not being able to structure the day might lead to stress and anxiety.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It’s a separate user group as there is a broad spectrum of how functional users are. Some people need a friendly reminder about daily activities while others need help with remembering what day it is and getting help with when to eat.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/abilia-memoplanner-2.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Tablet with MEMOPlanner app&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;process&quot;&gt;Process:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research user group&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define hypotheses&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Iterate concepts&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Final design&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;No usability testing, with the primary user group, could be done until after product launch due to regulations. Design decisions were based on hypotheses supported by research and best practice.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I started by reading literature and interviewing internally, focusing on trying to understand the difference between mild and severe cognitive disabilities. It gave me a general picture of what problems people within the group experience and I could then form hypotheses.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;tools&quot;&gt;Tools:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Balsamiq&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Photoshop&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Illustrator&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;InVision&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;From here it continued as an agile project as I started working with the technical and product management side. I was one sprint ahead with designing graphics. Together we defined functionality simultaneously as I iterated concepts for managers to sign off.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;platforms&quot;&gt;Platforms:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Android&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Web&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;MEMOPlanner was launched in December 2016 and have been praised by its users ever since.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;in-retrospect&quot;&gt;In retrospect:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define specific and measurable goals together with the client&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Define personal expectations and ask for the same&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Use internal knowledge but dare to challenge&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Everyone has the right to have a digital life&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Before earning my MSc degree, I did my final project on the subject of trying to understand the underlying facts behind why 9000 children die every year in traffic accidents in China. Volvo Cars have always been at the top in regards to car safety and wanted to know how they can have a positive impact on an emerging market.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/th_1.png&quot; alt=&quot;Comparison of traffic child mortality between China and USA&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;Together with my fellow researcher/classmate  Emma Nyström, we headed to Shanghai with the question “How to increase the usage of child restraint systems (child seats) in China?”.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/th_4.png&quot; alt=&quot;Project methodology&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;the-project-consisted-of-three-parts&quot;&gt;The project consisted of three parts:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Research&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Synthesis&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Action&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/th_3.png&quot; alt=&quot;Map of important cities in China&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;It was a research-heavy project. More than 60 qualitative interviews with families in tier 1, 2 and 3 cities were carried out.  In the quest of identifying underlying patterns towards questionable attitudes towards traffic safety, this was unique research material.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We got help from an excellent team (Su Ao and Zhou Qian) with interviews, transcriptions and everything we needed for the synthesis and coding of the qualitative data.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;There were two main findings from the interviews. Lack of knowledge about what implications a car accident has and the power of the “little emperor”. Families who had spent time abroad had a better understanding of the consequences a car accident brings. Little emperor refers to the (often only) child in the family who’s comfort were put first.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The action part of the project was to propose a potential solution to the problem of changing behaviour among parents. We ended up presenting the concept “Child Safety Circle”, an information campaign about learning and educating your inner circle.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;workshop-brief&quot;&gt;Workshop brief:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;p&gt;“Object that carries Culture: designing an artefact for the rural ways of living”.  Here, culture has two meanings: local heritage and the latest technology. The result of the workshop will be a part of Shanghai Design Week and Nordic Design Week in Shanghai 2013.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;I teamed up with two students from Tongji University, and together we spent the first two weeks in the Chinese countryside interviewing local artisans and learned about Chinese culture and history.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/desis_1.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Man carving in bamboo&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;h4 id=&quot;research-learnings&quot;&gt;Research learnings:&lt;/h4&gt;
&lt;ul&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Locals were proud of their heritage&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Even though living a simple life they were pleased&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;They were worried about younger people moving into cities&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Many city-people had never been out on the countryside&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;Nature has a symbolic meaning in Chinese culture but is starting to be forgotten by the younger generation&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ul&gt;

&lt;p&gt;For the second part of the workshop, we went back to Shanghai and started exploring ideas for our final concept. When combining the research insights with the project brief, we identified three fundamental questions to investigate.&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;ol&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can urban kids learn about craftsmanships?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can we bridge the gap between urban and rural people?&lt;/li&gt;
  &lt;li&gt;How can we make sure that people from cities take time to visit the countryside?&lt;/li&gt;
&lt;/ol&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We quickly got hooked on the idea of using lights when we pondered back on the starry sky and all the fireflies in the countryside. If there were a way to be remembered about that special occasion or any other particular moment which were only accessible outside the city. Some iterations later we had an idea we were confident with and moved on.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;figure&gt;
  &lt;img src=&quot;http://localhost:4000/images/desis_3.jpg&quot; alt=&quot;Light installation concept in Shanghai&quot; /&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;

&lt;p&gt;We named our final concept The Occalight which was an installation art concept consisting of handmade lamps to hang in city parks and which changed colours depending on what was happening in the nearby countryside. For instance, when the lavenders were blooming the lights would be purple, and people who were strolling by could use their smartphones and get information about the event and how to get there to experience it themselves.&lt;/p&gt;

&lt;p&gt;The concept was also meant to be directed towards kids since they could be part of producing the lamps as an after-school activity. The material would be bamboo from local areas which were laser cut and made into pieces for them to assemble,  like a 3D puzzle.&lt;/p&gt;
