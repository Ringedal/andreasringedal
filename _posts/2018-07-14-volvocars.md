Before earning my MSc degree, I did my final project on the subject of trying to understand the underlying facts behind why 9000 children die every year in traffic accidents in China. Volvo Cars have always been at the top in regards to car safety and wanted to know how they can have a positive impact on an emerging market.

Together with my fellow researcher/classmate  Emma Nyström, we headed to Shanghai with the question "How to increase the usage of child restraint systems (child seats) in China?".

#### The project consisted of three parts:
1. Research
2. Synthesis
3. Action

It was a research-heavy project. More than 60 qualitative interviews with families in tier 1, 2 and 3 cities were carried out.  In the quest of identifying underlying patterns towards questionable attitudes towards traffic safety, this was unique research material.

We got help from an excellent team (Su Ao and Zhou Qian) with interviews, transcriptions and everything we needed for the synthesis and coding of the qualitative data.

There were two main findings from the interviews. Lack of knowledge about what implications a car accident has and the power of the "little emperor". Families who had spent time abroad had a better understanding of the consequences a car accident brings. Little emperor refers to the (often only) child in the family who's comfort were put first.

The action part of the project was to propose a potential solution to the problem of changing behaviour among parents. We ended up presenting the concept "Child Safety Circle", an information campaign about learning and educating your inner circle.
