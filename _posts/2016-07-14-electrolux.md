Electrolux is transitioning into the digital era by making connectivity and Internet of Things a priority. They had developed a low-fidelity prototype for controlling a washing machine via a smartphone app. I was hired together with a colleague from inUse to perform usability tests, highlight problems and make suggestions for improvements.

#### Goals:
* Write scripts and questionnaires
* Set test environment
* Perform tests
* Identify problem areas
* Deliver test summary

As always when it comes to usability testing (which is also the fun part), be prepared for the unexpected and be curious how other resonate. For these tests, a methodology developed by designers from Electrolux were used, measuring effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction for every task.

Tests were held in Acreo's UX Lab in Stockholm. When arranging the setting, our top priority was to record the phone's screen to see how participants interacted as well as catching hand gestures. Secondly, we had one camera focusing on the participants face to capture facial expressions. For audio recording, we had a hidden microphone inside a folded towel.

#### Test procedure:
1. Background questionnaire
2. Initial exploration to capture first interaction and impressions, expectations and mental model for the UI
3. Task scenarios,  collecting data of performance, effectiveness and efficiency.
4. Satisfaction questionnaire
5. Semi-structured post-use interview

Although participants weren’t aware of the number of people watching they did sense the presence of others. It was a challenge to make participants feel comfortable doing the test, especially for the part when they pretended to operate a washing machine by clicking on a paper prototype.

Usually, you quickly get a feeling for in what part of the test most test persons are going to struggle. It’s easy to judge too soon and draw conclusions, but as long as you continue to ask open questions and make sure they resonate about their actions, the unexpected insights will come.

#### In retrospect:
* Usability testing is how you catch the unexpected ideas early
* A well-structured test and report have a more significant impact within the organisation
