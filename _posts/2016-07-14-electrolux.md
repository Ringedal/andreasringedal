Electrolux is transitioning into the digital era by making connectivity and Internet of Things a priority. They had a low-fidelity interactive prototype for controlling a washing machine via a smartphone app. I was hired together with a colleague to perform usability tests, highlight problems and make suggestions for improvements.

#### Goals:
* Write scripts and questionnaires
* Set test environment
* Perform tests
* Identify problem areas with the app
* Deliver test summary

As always when it comes to usability testing (which is also the fun part), be prepared for the unexpected and be totally open towards how other resonate. For these tests, a methodology developed by designers from Electrolux were used, measuring effectiveness, efficiency and satisfaction for every task.

Tests were done in Acreo's UX Lab in Stockholm. When arranging the setting we gave top priority to catch and record the phone's screen to see how participants interacted as well as looking at hand gestures. Secondly, we had one camera focusing on the face to catch facial expressions. The microphone was hidden in the towel behind the screen.

Cameras, microphones and a big see-through mirror for spectators to watch the test. Although participants weren’t aware of the number of people watching they did sense the presence of others. It was a challenge to make participants feel comfortable doing the test, especially for the part when they pretended to operate the washing machine by clicking on a paper prototype.

Usually, you quickly get a feeling for what most participants are going to struggle with. It’s easy to judge too quickly and draw conclusions but as long as you continue to ask open questions and make sure the participant is thinking aloud, the unexpected insights will come.

#### Test procedure:
1. Background questionnaire
2. Initial exploration to capture first interaction and impressions, expectations and mental model for the UI
3. Task scenarios,  collecting data of performance, effectiveness and efficiency.
4. Satisfaction questionnaire
5. Semi-structured post-use interview

#### In retrospect:
* Usability testing is necessary and fun
* This is how you catch the unexpected insights early
* A well-structured test and report have a bigger impact within the organization
