What do you get when you mix Medtech, IoT and asthma?

Turbu+!

By attaching a small device to your asthma inhaler, you can easily track your daily inhalations and get reminders on your phone if you missed one.

#### Goals:
* Design new solutions for existing product
* Deliver wireframes and user stories
* Act as support for decisions regarding UX and design
* Consider Medtech regulations

I worked together with colleagues from inUse with implementing new functionality for the Turbu+ app, which supports various markets. The app itself is for end users, and there is a web portal for doctors who can track their patient's data.

For this release, the primary focus was on self-enrollment and symptom tracking.

#### Platforms:
* iOS
* Android
* Web

The self-enrollment sequence was more complex from a technical viewpoint. From a user perspective, it was a reasonably simple sign-up process. What we did include in the on-boarding process though, were instructions on how to assemble the device and pair it with the phone via Bluetooth.

The user does symptom tracking, and the idea of symptom tracking itself was more complicated since everyone is different and experience his or her symptoms in different ways. We spoke to specialists in the field to boil it down to something tangible and useful for the users. Some weeks before the project deadline, the managers decided to bring in a ready solution for symptom tracking as it was clinically tested and approved, a significant factor for companies in the medical field.

The upside was that our solutions were more or less the same, at least an ego boost. The flip-side was that our UI patterns were completely different. Reminding time of the project we focused on finding ways for how to implement the complete solution and make sure it would have the same look and feel like the overall GUI.

#### Tools used:
* Sketch
* Principle
* InVision
* Zeplin

#### Process
We worked in-house with the creative process. Sketching, thinking and interviewing. At the end of every deadline, we presented ideas and made proposals. Always one sprint ahead.

For every successful sign-off, we then produced wireframes, visual assets and guidelines for developers. I also took on the challenge of animating the app using Principle, used for external usability testing.

#### In retrospect:
* There are many regulations within the healthcare
* The art of getting your design approved when dealing with many stakeholders
* Arguing for the impact of design in a somewhat conservative market
* How to merge two completely different apps into one's such an exciting field with endless possibilities.
