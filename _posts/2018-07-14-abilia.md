Is the web really for everyone? No, it’s not. There is a group of people who are foreseen by not being able to browse websites nor use apps because of their special needs. Abilia develop products to make sure these people become more independent and can take control of their everyday life.

I was Design Lead in the work with developing the new version of MEMOPlanner, helping people with cognitive impairments become more independent in their life.

#### Goals:
* Redesign MEMOPlanner
* Design new UI patterns
* Keep key features
* Deliver graphics
* Craft wireframes
* Put together a design guideline for the developers

A person with a cognitive disorder can be affected in different ways. Abilities such as learning, memory, perception and problem solving can be heavily reduced. Not being able to structure the day might lead to stress and anxiety.

It’s a scattered user group as there is a wide spectrum of how functional users are. Some people need a friendly reminder about daily activities while others need help with remembering what day it is and getting help with when to eat.

#### Process:
1. Research user group
2. Define hypotheses
3. Iterate concepts
4. Final design

Due to regulations, no usability testing could be done with the main target group until afterwards. Decisions were made based on design hypotheses sprung from research and best praxis.

I started by reading literature and interviewing internally, focusing on the difference between mild and severe cognitive disabilities and the general problem people within the spectrum experience.

That led me to define several design hypotheses which would guide me during the concept phase.

#### Tools:
* Balsamiq
* Photoshop
* Illustrator
* InVision

From here it continued as an agile project as I started working with the technical and product management side. I was one sprint ahead with designing graphics. Together we defined functionality simultaneously as I iterated concepts for managers to sign off.

#### Platforms:
* Android
* Web

MEMOPlanner was launched in December 2016 and have been praised by its users ever since.

#### In retrospect:
* Define specific and measurable goals together with the client
* Define personal expectations and ask for the same
* Use internal knowledge but dare to challenge
* Everyone has the right to have a digital life
